    "# Duration and Convexity Hedging: Techniques to Mitigate Interest Rate Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Duration and convexity are key measures of interest rate sensitivity for fixed-income securities. Hedging based on these measures allows investors to mitigate interest rate risk by offsetting the impact of changes in interest rates on bond prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understand Duration and Convexity**: Explore the concepts of duration and convexity and their impact on bond prices.\n",
    "- **Implement Hedging Techniques**: Use real data to analyze and implement hedging strategies based on duration and convexity.\n",
    "- **Example Calculation**: Calculate duration and convexity for a hypothetical bond and demonstrate a hedging strategy.\n",

    "- **Duration**: A measure of a bond's sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The higher the duration, the more sensitive the bond is to rate changes.\n",
    "- **Convexity**: A measure of the curvature in the relationship between bond prices and interest rates, capturing the rate at which duration changes as yields change.\n",
