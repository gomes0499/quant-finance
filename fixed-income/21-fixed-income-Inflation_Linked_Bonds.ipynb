    "## Overview\n",
    "Inflation-linked bonds, also known as inflation-indexed bonds, are bonds whose principal or interest payments adjust based on inflation rates. These bonds help protect investors from the eroding effects of inflation on purchasing power.\n",

    "Inflation-linked bonds are designed to protect investors against inflation. The principal or interest payments on these bonds are adjusted periodically based on inflation, typically measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Inflation Adjustment**: The bond's principal value adjusts with inflation, and interest is paid on the adjusted principal.\n",
