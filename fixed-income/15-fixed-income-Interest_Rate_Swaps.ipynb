    "Interest rate swaps are a type of derivative contract in which two parties exchange cash flows based on different interest rates. These swaps are often used to hedge interest rate exposure or to adjust the interest rate characteristics of a portfolio.\n",

    "\n",
    "The parties do not exchange the principal amount; they only exchange interest payments based on the notional value. Swaps are used to manage interest rate risk, adjust cash flows, or take advantage of anticipated rate movements.\n"
