    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Convertible bonds are hybrid securities that combine characteristics of both bonds and stocks. They offer fixed income through regular coupon payments, with the added option to convert the bond into a specified number of shares of the issuing company's stock.\n",

    "\n",
    "Convertible bonds are debt securities that can be converted into a predetermined number of the issuer's equity shares at the bondholder's discretion. Key features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Coupon Payments**: Like traditional bonds, convertible bonds pay periodic interest, offering income stability.\n",
    "- **Conversion Option**: Convertible bonds include an option to convert into equity shares, providing potential upside if the company's stock price increases.\n",
    "- **Hybrid Nature**: These bonds combine debt and equity characteristics, making them unique in the fixed income universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investors often consider convertible bonds to balance income and growth potential.\n"

    "\n",
    "Convertible bonds have two main components that influence their value:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bond Value (Fixed Income Component)**: The bond's value as a fixed-income instrument, discounted based on coupon payments and maturity value.\n",
    "- **Conversion Value (Equity Component)**: The value if converted into equity, based on the current stock price and conversion ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convertible bond's value is typically the greater of its bond value or conversion value.\n"
