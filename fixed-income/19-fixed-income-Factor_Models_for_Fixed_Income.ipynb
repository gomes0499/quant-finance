    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Factor models in fixed income analysis help investors understand and quantify the risks associated with interest rates, credit, and liquidity. Multi-factor models use a combination of risk factors to estimate the sensitivity of bond prices to these sources of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Introduce Multi-Factor Models**: Understand the role of factor models in fixed income.\n",
    "- **Identify Key Risk Factors**: Explore interest rate, credit, and liquidity factors commonly used in fixed income analysis.\n",
    "- **Provide an Example Calculation**: Use a hypothetical multi-factor model to analyze the risk exposures of a bond portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Factor models are valuable tools for portfolio managers aiming to manage and hedge specific risks in fixed-income investments.\n"

    "\n",
    "Multi-factor models break down the price or yield of a bond into various risk components. Common factors include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interest Rate Factor**: Captures the sensitivity of bond prices to changes in interest rates. Often measured by duration or other rate-sensitive metrics.\n",
    "- **Credit Factor**: Reflects the bond's exposure to changes in credit spreads, representing the risk of credit deterioration or improvement.\n",
    "- **Liquidity Factor**: Measures the bond's sensitivity to changes in market liquidity, as less liquid bonds tend to carry additional risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing these factors, investors can better understand a bond's risk profile and manage their exposure accordingly.\n"

    "\n",
    "- **Interest Rate Sensitivity**: 0.5 (moderate sensitivity to interest rates)\n",
    "- **Credit Spread Sensitivity**: 0.3 (lower sensitivity to credit risk)\n",
    "- **Liquidity Sensitivity**: 0.2 (low sensitivity to liquidity changes)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use hypothetical shifts in each factor to calculate the expected impact on the bond's price.\n"
