    "### Numerical Integration and Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "Numerical integration and differentiation are essential techniques for approximating integrals and derivatives when analytical solutions are difficult or impossible to obtain. They are widely used in fields like engineering, physics, and finance, where precise calculations based on discrete data points or complex functions are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical Integration\n",
    "Numerical integration approximates the area under a curve by dividing it into small segments and summing them up. Common methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Trapezoidal Rule: Approximates the area under a curve using trapezoids.\n",
    "Simpson's Rule: Uses parabolic segments to approximate the area, providing higher accuracy for smooth curves.\n",
    "Monte Carlo Integration: Uses random sampling to approximate integrals, especially useful in high dimensions."
